#LJ-Code201-Pro3

The third day of project week started slow for me as I had a personal appointment for Vocational Rehab at the VA. I was in a catch22 situation as I needed to attend this meeting to obtain funding for school but I was also in the middle of project week so my 'personal time' and project time are not easily discernable. I apologized profusely and often to my team for my absence and they were both supportive and understanding. That still doesn't compensate for the lost productivity and time.  

The project continues to move forward at a rapid pace. I was able to spend the afternoon working on more HTML and CSS adding some cool animation and visual content. I also refined the About Us portion of our site to highlighting the purpose of the site and our teams individual contributions. Also I put together a user experience document that details the roles of climbers visiting the site, the perspectives of a Just Climb team members and founders and that of the team developers.

Excited to see it all coming together today and whether or not we will face any huge last minute hurdles.
