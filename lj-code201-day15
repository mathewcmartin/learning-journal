#LJ-Code201-day15

The journal is great but I feel like the ash of wick left after the candles burnt out from both ends. Not much fuel left and my brain is basically numb. Slowly pounding on homework which is a great review but I should be focusing on the test. I can only hope that I can both review and finish up before taking the test. Lots of work and little time. I feel pretty down at this stage thinking about my personal struggles and my financial situation so dependent on a positive outcome. Caring for my kids and juggling divorce mitigation while fulfilling my studies was perhaps to grandiose a dream. I hope my a good nights rest will improve my perspective.
