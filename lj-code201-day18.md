#LJ-Code201-Day18

Everything seemingly has an underlying purpose and well thought out reasoning. I suppose that is the way of programmers... trying to neatly tie things up in a framework full of boxes. I seemingly can't escape all the boxes truth be told. Ready to lay my weary box filled head down for some serious pillow time. Attempting to finally break away from the coding addiction and find solace in sleep. Every day it comes easier and more challenging... another of life's paradoxes.

Project week is progressing well. Our team is congealing and we are working thru the logic and styling. We kept our goals reasonable and seem to be attaining them so far. Hope to see it come together nicely tomorrow. Can't wait to see how the pieces fit together and if our plan holds.

Good night!
