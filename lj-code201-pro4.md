#LJ-Code201-Pro4

Today I learned that my teammates are awesome and have my back despite my misgivings. We are making major headway working thru minor issues and improving the look and functionality of our project Just Climb. My contribution was primarily dedicated to drying up the code today and ensuring the site functions without issue. We improved the look of our profile page showing climbers profile pics and statistics. Our form page has a nice pie graph now with a breakdown of the climbers by best match indicating who is most compatible with the new climber who enters their unique data. Further, our profiles page indicates the best match in order of sequence for highest to lowest. New climber functionality works and adds the new climber to the bottom of the profile list. My general stress level has diminished somewhat now that we have a little more breathing room and the fact that we kept our goals manageable and doable.
