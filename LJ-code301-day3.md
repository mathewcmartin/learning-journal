#LJ-code301-Day3

Starting to feel the impact of the course load on my time and energy. Understandably, after 201, I expected the amount of work, yet, I still find myself wanting and needing more time to accomplish the seemingly insurmountable amount of work I face. Our instructor has emphasized breaking problems down into workable pieces instead of being entirely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tasks at hand. This approach most importantly improves one's morale knowing that small contributions are what ultimately win at the end of the day. It is a game of mental attrition and only those who continue to trudge on benefit from reaching the 'light'. We are only defeated in our mind and my inability to quit fighting for knowledge and understanding is truly a personal motivating force. I hate stressing my inadequacies though the course is so holistic that it will not let you forget that coding is more than merely a professional skill but rather a way of life. Forcing one to adapt to weakness and overcome adversity one rigorous step at a time. Leaving that which has little positive force by the wayside mostly out of a simple lack of time. Despite all my failings I still feel that my contributions and efforts are not a total waste. The potential for growth and development on an interpersonal level is a gift that I will cherish through the rest of my daily grind and till the end of my time.
