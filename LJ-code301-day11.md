#LJ-code301-day11

##Day 11 Entry:

I'm struggling to keep up and it is finally being reflected in my marks. I missed 3-4 assignment deadlines over the weekend. I got so far behind on the portfolio and it has been weighing heavily on my conscience. Multiple issues both on campus and at home have distracted me from sticking to the small piece approach leaving me feeling buried under all I have to do. I feel like I have been able to keep up with the concepts but applying them to my portfolio has been very hard. Having the portfolio lag behind the labs by a day or two seems like it would be easy as the concepts should be mastered by that time. Yet, I feel that the lag gives me too much time between when we cover the material and when I finally get a chance to utilize it without the benefit of a lab partner or TA for assistance. Having to go back and piece together what we covered and how it is applied while covering new dependencies in class has left me confused and frustrated. Initially I thought the assignment was going to run in parallel and I tried to include comments about what we were covering and how it might apply to the portfolio but got burned early on by TAs stating it wasn't part of the assignment. That is fine but I got more and more behind. As functionality is added and removed I have lost place and can't catch back up without refactoring for every old assignment. This seems counter to how a project would function in the real world, akin to rolling back software to a previous version when what is newer and better has already been adopted. I take copious notes and an exhaustive amount of material to assist me exists but I suppose that is part of my issue trying to focus on what is current and discover the missing needle in the full stack of "Hey why did you do that days ago... it's so easy!".

At this stage I have resigned myself to needing to move at a slower pace. I have scheduled individual appointments/meetings with both Sam and Karinne so I can look at potentially retaking 301. I'm currently booked for python 401 in October and I have a long way to go before I'm ready for that apparently exhaustive program. Python is key to my career plans and putting myself in a reasonable position to grasp that material means a strong foundation in 301 which I can't say with any honesty that I'm there. Again, understanding the concepts is easy for me but applying the logic and writing the code is still a huge hurdle I need more time to master. Further, I know the that the sense of failure is not mine alone, and that it is not something that should make me feel bad at all, I'm just being honest with myself and staff with respect to my abilities. The last thing I want to do is be a disappointment to future employer and reflect poorly on those at Code Fellows who have provided me with every opportunity to succeed.
