##Learning Journal Day 10

Missed this assignment Saturday morning. Friday was an exhausting day and I didn't get home until late after a 6 hour lab assignment. Juggling kids and homework while keeping a household in order and accomplishing all the menial BS that comes with life on top of 301 has taken a mental toll. Saturday manifested into a day filled with personal stuff an little to nothing accomplished with respect to my portfolio. I'm really disappointed with myself for overlooking this assignment as I give a lot of thought to my journal and what I've learned. I respect the concept of "adult learning" and it's reliance on review. It is simply the culmination or perhaps the crossroad of multiple issues converging simultaneous and the lack of mental fortitude to adjust to everything. Perhaps I am being to hard on myself, however, the one thing that sticks out in my experience here at Code Fellows is that communicating my needs is clearly the best way to address my issues. Thanks~
