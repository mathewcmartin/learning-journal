#LJ Code 201 - Day 9

3/16/17

Enjoying using the console. It has been years since I've used a command prompt and reminds me of my early professional career using MSDOS and manually executing applications and navigating directory structures way back before GUIs became popular. Firing off old synapses lighting the cobwebs of my brain on fire. CSS formatting... meh. Slowly coming around. Found a cool keyboard shortcut cheatsheet for atom today and shared on slack with class. https://atom.io/packages/atom-shortcuts

OUT!
