#LJ-Code201-Day13

First learning journal that I created from bash command prompt. Nice! Feeling like I'm actually starting to not just understand the coding but that I'm starting to feel comfortable speaking it and maybe one day... lol, writing it as well. Or at least by any reasonable standard. Been so buried I thought suffocation was real. Having some how survived the gauntlet feeling like an orc in some Dungeon Master's hell, now I know that what doesn't kill me will not hose my computer so far as I can tell.

Per convo with Nick on slack...

I realized that coding is an extension of the written language we all speak. My humanities background is perfect for Python in that it most closely mirrors our speech in many ways. If life isn't Monty Python like, what is? We exist between the face of comedy and the face of tragedy. Black and White with only our own humanity in between. Age old struggles no different from the ancient Greeks.

Attempting to understand the deeper meaning seems perhaps a waste of time to some but truthfully marks my intrigue in this endeavor. Are we not all on a journey of understanding in hope of answering that all consuming and universal query... "who, what, when, where and why?" What's left likely cannot empirically be defined. That's where the humanities and our ability to shine fill the space with light and hopefully delight. Which is my segue to return to coding and the language I'm currently immersed. Respectfully!
