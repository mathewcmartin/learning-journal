#LJ-code301-day8

What a day... Speeding along at the code fellows clip... nary a break in stride while the knowledge piles on. One is either washed down stream or finds a toe hold. I've been blessed with a long series of capable lab partners and pray the good Lord, aka Liz the lead TA, has more on deck! Should my secret be found out I'm certain I will cry like an unfed babe.

We dove headlong into SQL and I lapped it up like a hungry pup. My IT experience in networking and communications is helping me I suspect from a theoretical perspective. 15 years as a tech going back to my Marine days in Comms passing encrypted TTY traffic cut in ASCII on paper tape all the way thru CCNA certification while working at IBM. Funny how I have little difficulty accepting the Database Icon of a cylinder representing a DB as I worked on a system that relied on [disk packs](http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102626624) for storage. Now likely only found in a museum... we can only hope.

I do have the sensation I've HALO jumped out of my 50,000 foot theoretical view and am now hurtling headlong toward the reality of the minutiae of an errant semicolon. Thankfully I've learned to accept reliance on others skill and expertise in guiding me thru my failings. Filling the obvious and unavoidable('pun intended') chasm left in my life, given my recent divorce, with purpose and a sense of professional pride.  Truly, Code Fellows has revived a strong sense of self esteem, fellowship and esprit d' corp that has been missing in my life. Filling the relational database of my mind with a string holding a key value pairing so hu-mongo only tomorrow can decipher it. 

Semper Fi!
