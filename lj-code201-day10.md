#LJ-Code201-Day10

Don't know where to start... kinda like in class. Trying desperately to keep up. Seem to be falling further and further behind. I was looking forward to catching up this weekend but didn't really get caught up on anything. I spun my wheels on the Cookie-Stand form logic and without any available support just beat my head against that seemingly immovable object. Pun intended! Further, I wasn't able to prioritize effectively and finish the work I was capable of finishing. This reinforces my desire to work on my time management skills and my need to prioritize what is most critical and important.

Additional personal stressors have added to my struggles I suppose mimicking real world happenstance. The cumulative weight is building callouses and creating muscle memory at an astonishing rate. I can literally feel my brain growing and the need to shed any dead weight. I have my kids this week for the first time since class started and hope the added burden won't impact me too greatly. They are pretty self sufficient fortunately and I got most of my chores complete preparing for them over the weekend. My youngest was home sick last week and I'm praying they will both stay healthy and in school.

It was in my sophomore year of high school the last time I attended school full time without a part time or full time job. I thought this alone would free me to pursue my coding aspirations. I should not be surprised that it is requiring everything I have to absorb so much so fast. I'm reminded of marine corps bootcamp and the mental aspects surprising me at their difficulty when I had presumed it would be the physical aspects which would be most challenging. Rote memorization is not my thing and the realization that only thru repetitive and deliberate study will I grasp and remember so much material. Determined to stay positive and focused on the end goal and not allow my feelings to command my actions.
