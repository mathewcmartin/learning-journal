#LJ Code-301-Day 15

##Project Week

Today started project week as Monday was a Memorial Day holiday and there was no class on that day. We started a day early to compensate for the loss of time. Our team was chosen by staff and we picked a project to work on. We chose seattlereads.com as our project which is a website that accesses the Seattle Public Library's API for checkouts and analyzes their data and returns information the user requests about checkouts or specifically "what Seattle reads". 

Our team started off fast out of the gate with a lot of passion and ideas about how we can best accomplish the task in the given period of time. We seem singularly focused on the mission and have little distractions to date staying on point. Our de facto team leader is Matthew Parker who came up with the idea and has already started crafting the logic required to deliver the data to the website. We did not meet over the weekend which may hinder us with respect to time. We will see...

Overall the week went well and I seemed able to climb out of the pit I was neck deep in at this time last week. Looking forward to pounding away at our project and seeing how productive we can be this week. I still have a lot of personal issues I haven't been entirely able to address during my course work and I'm trying hard to leave them on the sideline this week while I attend to my project tasks. I have my kids this week, which also adds some stress getting pulled in multiple directions. I've done my very best to accommodate all parties while holding on tightly to my priorities like passing 301 and prepping for 401 in October. I feel sometimes like I'm juggling hot branding irons or maybe chainsaws... either way, I've got my hands full in the short term.
