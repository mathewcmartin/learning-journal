#LJ-code301-day1#

May 8th 2017

First day of class was much like 201 as I recall in the sense that the instructor and staff were very positive and motivating us toward our chosen path in coding. Having proven by our collective actions in showing up and providing the requisite 'skin in the game' there was little fuss with regard to getting to the business at hand. Most of the day was dedicated to administration and logistics requisite in ensuring the entire cohort shared Sam's 'sheet of music' and he did a wonderfully through job of covering the details without any presumption.

The very end of the day was dedicated to paired programming and our initial dip of the toe in jQuery programming. I enjoyed the exercise and realize only after successfully completing the lab how much I've missed the camaraderie and esprit of my fellow coders. Though only a handful of my 201 classmates are in my 301 iteration  I already feel at home and welcome in my new cohort, making friends and pleased to be neck deep back in my study.
