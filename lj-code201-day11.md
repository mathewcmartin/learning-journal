Pretty tanked after a weekend of heavy catch up. Pretty happy with the program. Feel as if I'm retaining much and learning a whole lot more. Pretty tough making the transition from casual knowledge to in depth understanding. The lab went much better today with an flay out focus and concerted effort toward maximizing collaboration. I think we have one person in class capable of doing it alone at this stage. It is somewhat reassuring that I'm not alone in my complete and utter inefficiencies in writing the code. However, much like any language I suppose, the process doesn't begin with speaking. Even last night when my eyes were crossing I kept thinking about how far I've come and in such a short amount of time. It is already becoming second hand and some rudimentary task are performed without thought and reliant on 'muscle memory' alone.

Was able to complete most of the lab yesterday with assistance from my team. Couldn't get the final piece of JS logic dealing with event listeners before I ran out of time. Completed most of the rudimentary HTML/CSS with only a few aesthetic tweaks remaining. Trying desperately to find some additional time in my already overbooked day to get past homework updated and completed before this Friday's deadline. I didn't foresee the cutoff and with 301 entrance exam this weekend I'm not sure I will have the requisite points to pass the course. This should be stressing me out but I'm somehow remaining calm and unstressed. Perhaps the past month or so of mental torment has finally subsided, yet, the prospects of what lies ahead seems as daunting as ever.
