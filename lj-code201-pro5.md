Can't believe I missed the deadline for this assignment. I was just thinking last night how much my time management has improved due my commitment to the 201 course. I've always struggled with this aspect of my life and my ability to transition from my focus and task at hand and keep another foot placed solidly in the world around me. I've been diagnosed with myopia and though it is thought widely to be a handicap requiring correction, I've found later in life, when everyone's vision seemingly diminishes due some event in our biological code, that my 'uncorrected' vision allows me clear and focused vision up close. My mind seemingly loses focus on the background and all those considerations seemingly wash away. It becomes an almost meditative experience. Without the benefit of coding reminders into my phone to break me out of this focus other tasks go unknown. The moral is that my connection to the 'world' is better with code.

Our presentation went great and the recruiter who preceded our demos sparked thoughts of employment and career branding that have long lay dormant and virtually untouched for years. Reminding of how this experience is part of what I'd planned seemingly so many years ago. Yet, the weak links in that personal story require much refinement and reevaluation along those lines and how Code Fellows and all those new contacts and experiences will help me grow.
