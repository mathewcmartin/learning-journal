#LJ-code301-day6

Plowing thru the first week with enthusiasm and charm... well, maybe enthusiasm and no harm to the innocent. Enjoying the challenge and embracing the feelings of failure and depression like they are just part of a normal day. Content in the knowledge that what doesn't kill will just make me money one day. I've managed to submit all my assignments on time though I've taken hits on points on nearly every assignment to date struggling to balance learning new material while mastering what we've learned and staying on top of the workload. Given how slow I read due my challenges with dyslexia, it is increasingly difficult to stay up with my cohort. I know I won't have a complete understanding of the material without practice so it is a constant struggle to manage my time most effectively to determine what I can accomplish during the time given. There is never enough and calling it at the end of the day is hard knowing so much remains on my plate. All I can do is the best I can and hope I will be able to resubmit my assignments in the end.

We covered so much material last week reviewing and adding new topics and skills. We are diving headlong into Node.js today after covering Ajax and the JSON in a day. I'm excited by the pace yet know that what I retain is entirely upto how much practice I get impllementing what I've learned. Otherwise the information will simply be overwritten by the next best thing to come along. The analogy of car mechanics comes to mind. First one learns to change the oil before learning more significant maintenance. Getting a peek under the hood before picking up a wrench and diving in. Javascript is much the same way... one needs to understand basic operations before building a car from scratch.
